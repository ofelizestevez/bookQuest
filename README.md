# BookQuest Modernization Project

This project is an extension of the original BookQuest project, an online bookshelf management tool that allows users to easily find and save books tailored to their interests. This project was originally developed by IT490's Tech Team during the Spring semester of 2024 at the new Jersey Institute of technology.

## Motivation

As a member of Tech Team, I have decided to revisit the project with the aim of modernizing it from the ground up. While I am proud of the original project, there are many chances to improve upon the original architecture. The goal of this modernization effort is to use modern technology and best practices to showcase my skills in software engineering and full-stack development. Ultimately, I aim to create a beautiful website with improved user experience and scalability.

## Technologies and Services

The modernized BookQuest project will utilize a range of technologies and services to achieve its objectives. These include:

- **Frontend Framework**: React with Next.js
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexibility and scalability
- **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka for asynchronous task management
- **Load Balancer**: Traefik for traffic routing and load balancing
- **Authentication**: JWT for user authentication and authorization
- **Containerization**: Docker for packaging and deploying services
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Swarm for managing and scaling containers
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: GitHub Actions for automating build, test, and deployment processes
- **Networking**: Tailscale for simplified networking and secure communication
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging and analysis

## Project Goals

The primary goals of the modernization project are:

- **Modernization**: Implement modern technologies and best practices to enhance the performance, scalability, and maintainability of the BookQuest application.
- **Skill Showcase**: Demonstrate proficiency in software engineering and full-stack development by showcasing expertise in modern tools and frameworks.
- **Feature Enhancement**: Enhance the original BookQuest project with additional features, improved user experience, and better integration with external services.
